Book Store Website Application – Berra Taşdemir S025182
My website application has; sign-in and sign-up functionalities and the header buttons are dynamic so that we can switch between pages as we see in the page flow diagram. 
The "Add to Cart" function is not available at the moment but we can see the mock-up page for the Shopping-Cart as well.
